# DSA_Practice 🚀

Welcome to **DSA_Practice** — a personal repository by [Nikhil Kumar](https://github.com/Nikhilsingh46) for practicing and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.

This repository currently includes:
- ✅ Conditional Statements
- 🔁 Loops
- 🔷 Pattern Printing

More DSA topics will be added soon!

## 📄 Available Files

### 🔸 [`conditional_statement.java`](https://github.com/Nikhilsingh46/DSA_Practice-/blob/main/conditional_statement.java)

This file covers Java conditional logic with real-world examples.

#### ✅ Functions:
- `GreatNum(int A, int B)` – Returns the greater number
- `isAdult(int age)` – Checks adulthood (age ≥ 18)
- `OddorEven(int num)` – Identifies if a number is odd or even
- `TotalTax(int income)` – Computes tax based on income slabs
- `largFthree(int a, int b, int c)` – Finds the greatest of three numbers

### 🔸 [`PatternPrinting.java`](https://github.com/Nikhilsingh46/DSA_Practice-/blob/main/PatternPrinting.java)

This file contains a rich set of **pattern printing** problems using nested loops.

#### ✨ Included Patterns:
- 🔹 Right-angled triangle of stars
- 🔹 Inverted triangle of stars
- 🔹 Half pyramid with numbers
- 🔹 Hollow rectangle
- 🔹 Half-inverted triangle (right-aligned)
- 🔹 Inverted number triangle
- 🔹 Floyd's triangle
- 🔹 0-1 triangle
- 🔹 Butterfly pattern
- 🔹 Solid rhombus
- 🔹 Hollow rhombus
- 🔹 Diamond pattern

📌 All methods are modular. You can uncomment any function call from `main()` to test it by entering `n`.
