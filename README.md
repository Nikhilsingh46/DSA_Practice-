# DSA_Practice

Welcome to **DSA_Practice** — a personal repository by [Nikhil Kumar](https://github.com/Nikhilsingh46) created for practicing core concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.

This repo currently contains Java programs focusing on:
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

More DSA topics will be added regularly.

## 📄 Available Files

### 🔸 [`conditional_statement.java`](https://github.com/Nikhilsingh46/DSA_Practice-/blob/main/conditional_statement.java)

A Java program demonstrating the use of conditional statements with real-world logic.

#### ✅ Functions:
- `GreatNum(int A, int B)` – Returns the greater of two numbers
- `isAdult(int age)` – Checks if the person is 18 or older
- `OddorEven(int num)` – Determines if a number is odd or even
- `TotalTax(int income)` – Calculates tax based on Indian income slabs
- `largFthree(int a, int b, int c)` – Finds the greatest of three numbers

### 🔸 `PLQ.java` *(New)*

This Java file includes **basic loop-based problems** to improve logical thinking and flow control using:
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do-while` loops

#### ✅ Examples included:
- Print numbers from 1 to N
- Print sum of first N natural numbers
- Factorial of a number
- Multiplication table
- Reverse digits of a number
- Check if number is palindrome
- Count digits in a number
- Print even numbers in a range
- Print odd numbers in a range
- Print all divisors of a number

> Advanced and intermediate loop patterns will be added soon!
